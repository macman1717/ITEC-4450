<h1>Welcome to the GGC Online Store</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        This is a place where GGC students can buy and sell used items like books, electronics, furniture, and more.
        You can browse all available items without logging in.
        But to buy or sell, you’ll need to <a href="login.php">log in</a> or <a href="sign-up.php">create an account.</a>
        It’s quick and easy — just sign up, and you’ll be able to post your own listings or add items to your cart.
        Happy browsing!
